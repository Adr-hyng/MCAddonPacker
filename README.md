# MC Bedrock Addon Packer
Minecraft Bedrock Addon Packer to easily make or test a template or production addon.
Created by Adr-hyng

# Why is this created?

It's not the most useful thing in the world. It packs your production or template folder addon into a `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon` format, so you can use it inside the minecraft bedrock or pocket edition for development or production. Example of this repo is a template addon.


# How to use

To use, you need Python, required packages are already built-in inside python. 
To start, download or clone this repo, then, run the `main.py` python file on this directory you've downloaded or cloned. After running, there will be a `.mcaddon` which was compiled by this program. Namely `Test Addon.mcaddon`. There you can put your behavior pack folder or resource pack folder to that directory to automatically pack stuffs for you.
